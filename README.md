#ARIA-Accessibility
This is the repository for the Building an Accessible Web Page with ARIA assignment with CodeX.

## About the Project
Create an HTML web page that effectively utilizes ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) tags to enhance accessibility. This exercise aims to solidify your understanding of web accessibility principles and the practical application of ARIA tags.

For this particular project, I'm reusing the final html, js and css from the form we created in the previous assignment and updating it with ARIA to make it more accessible for others that may need to use web accessibility to read a site. 

## Files
-index.html
-styles.css
-script.js

## Features
-User input validation
-Displays submitted data dynamically
-Prevents default form submission behavior

## How it Works
-Users enter the required information, including: 
-First & Last Name (text inputs)
-Email (email input)
-Password (minlength 6, required)
-Birthdate (date input)
-Interests (checkboxes)
-Submit Button

## ARIA Updates
-Paragraphs (`<p>`) explaining the purpose of ARIA and web accessibility in your own words.
-An input field with an aria-label.
-A second input field with an associated `<label>` tag.
-A button with an aria-label.
-A link with a button role attribute  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/button_role
-Comments in the code explaining the purpose of each ARIA tag used.

## Accessibility Testing
Tested using built-in screen reader tools to confirm that ARIA updates were announced correctly.
